========
Overview
========

CL-GTK2 is a Common Lisp GUI library that provides access to the `Gtk+`_ 
cross-platform GUI library in idiomatic Lisp style.

CL-GTK2 should portably work in most modern Lisps that support CFFI and MOP 
(see :ref:`compatibility`).

Messages regarding development, feature requests, bug reports should be posted 
to `cl-gtk2-devel`_ mailing list.

`clgtk2 blog`_ contains news on development of CL-GTK2.

Features
========

* Provides Gtk+ API in a Lispy way
* Binds large part of Gtk+ API
* Objects and classes are mapped into CLOS objects and classes
* Gtk+ objects are garbage collected
* Error in objects' signal handlers are restartable
* Provides some higher-level abstractions over Gtk+ facilities:
  * Calling code in GUI thread (call-within-main-loop, call-within-main-loop-and-wait)
  * Displaying progress-bar for long-running code (with-progress-bar)
  * Displaying errors (with-gtk-message-error-handler)

CL-GTK2 is not yet complete. To do
==================================

* Better implementation of type mapping Done
* Change weak references to toggle references Done
* Better support for subclassing objects and defining GObject classes 
  implemented in lisp
* Complete API binding
* Support for wide range of Lisp compilers and interpreters
* Support for Gtk+ on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X
* Write documentation and tutorial
* High-level API for user interface building
* An introductory screencast
